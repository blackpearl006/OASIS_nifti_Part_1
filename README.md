# OASIS NIfTI Dataset

## Introduction

Welcome to the OASIS NIfTI dataset repository! This repository contains the OASIS-1 dataset in the NIfTI format (.nii.gz) split into 12 parts. The original data, which was in .img and .hdr formats, has been converted into the more widely used NIfTI format using FSL_UTILS.

## About the OASIS-1 Dataset

The OASIS-1 dataset is a collection of cross-sectional MRI data from 416 subjects, covering the adult life span from ages 18 to 96. It includes both young, middle-aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. The dataset also comprises individuals with early-stage Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). Each subject has 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained within a single imaging session.

For subjects over the age of 60, 100 have been diagnosed with very mild to mild AD. Additionally, 20 nondemented subjects have images from a subsequent scan session after a short delay (less than 90 days) to assess acquisition reliability.

All data have been anonymized to allow for public distribution. Facial features were removed at the fMRIDC (http://www.fmridc.org) using the Brain Extraction Tool. The full dataset is 15.8 GB compressed and 50 GB uncompressed.

The OASIS-1 dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists interested in brain imaging, neurodegenerative diseases, and related fields.

## Dataset Organization

The OASIS NIfTI dataset has been split into 12 parts to facilitate easy access and download. Each part is available as a compressed .tar file, with each file being approximately 10 GB in size. The division into parts makes it more manageable to work with and download, ensuring a smoother experience for users.
